var1 = "Hello, I'm learning Python"
print(var1)

#Python is dinamically typed, it means variables can be named
#and replace their values anytime in the program
#For example:
print('----------')
var2 = 1234
print(var2)
var2 = 5678
print(var2)

print('----------')
var3 = 22.22
print(var3)
var3 = 1111.4444
print(var3)

print('----------')
var4 = True
print(var4)
var4 = False
