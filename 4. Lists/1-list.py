fruits = ['apple','banana','orange','grapes','lemon']
print(fruits)
print('----------------')
cars = ['toyota','ford','chevrolet','hyundai','volkswagen']
print(cars)

print('----------------')
print('----------------')

#List items are:
                #ordered
                #changeable
                #allow duplicate values

#list are indexed as [0]...[n]

'''
Ordered means that the items have a defined order
that cannot be chenged.
Changeable means that we can change, add or remove items in
the list after it's been created.
Allow duplicates means that list can have items with the same
value, since they're indexed.
