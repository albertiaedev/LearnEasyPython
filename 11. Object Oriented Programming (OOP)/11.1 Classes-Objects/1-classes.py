'''
Almost everything in Python is an object,
with its properties and methods.
A Class is like an object constructor,
or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
'''

#to create a class, use the keyword 'class'

class Example: #use capital letters to name a class
  var1 = 100

#now we can use the class named Example to create objects

object = Example()
print(object.var1)
