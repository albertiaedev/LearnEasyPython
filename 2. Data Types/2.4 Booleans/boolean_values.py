'''
Booleans are data with two types of values,
it could be True if the outcome turns out to be positive,
or it could be False if the outcome turns out to be negative.
'''

#we've seen them in the previous module, naming variables
#that contains these data types
True + True = True
True + False = False
False + True = False
False + False = False

'''
Booleans are useful for making conditional statements
that you can review in module 7.
