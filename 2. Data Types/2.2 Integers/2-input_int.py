'''
We can ask the user insert a value of his choice. In this case,
we're asking for an integer value which can be specified just by
naming a variable that contains the word int and in round brackets
we write the word input plus the action to perform in another set
of round brackets.
'''

#For example:
input = int(input("Enter an integer number: "))
