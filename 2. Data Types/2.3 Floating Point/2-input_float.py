'''
We can ask the user insert a value of his choice. In this case,
we're asking for a floating point value which can be specified
just by naming a variable that contains the word float and in round
brackets we write the word input plus the action to perform in
another set of round brackets.
'''

#For example:
input = float(input("Enter a floating point number: "))
